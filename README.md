All of my wallpapers, hosted on github. 
You can add puller.bat or puller.sh as a scheduled task to automatically pull from the repo as often as you'd like. The repo is sporadically updated with new wallpapers 

# Credit
Most are from 4chan's /wg/ and /w/ boards (mostly /wg/), where crediting for photos isn't enforced or part of the culture at all.
Some are from wikimedia, where I understand photos are free to download and use however you'd like.

yotsugi.jpg is from https://x.com/yahiro_pi/status/986197679788011521/photo/1

There are some photos I've taken in here, here's a list of them. Share and reproduce as much as you want, but don't use them to make money or profit without first contacting me (you can reach me at hannahbruch03@gmail.com)
