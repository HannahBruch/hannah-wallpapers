All of my wallpapers, hosted on github. 
You can add puller.bat or puller.sh as a scheduled task to automatically pull from the repo as often as you'd like. I update the repo with new wallpapers sporadically. 
Currently the python script doesn't work. (It's meant to automatically upload new wallpapers to github and automatically 
pull from the github repo, synchronizing wallpapers across all devices). 

# Credit
Most are from 4chan's /wg/ and /w/ boards (mostly /wg/), where crediting for photos isn't enforced or part of the culture at all.
Some are from wikimedia, where I understand photos are free to download and use however you'd like.

There are some photos I've taken in here, here's a list of them. Share and reproduce as much as you want, but don't use them to make money or profit without first contacting me (you can reach me at hannahbruch03@gmail.com)
